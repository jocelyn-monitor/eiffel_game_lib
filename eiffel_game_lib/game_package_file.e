	description: "[
		A game custom package file is a file that can contain other files (like a zip file,
		but not compressed). To create a package, use the custom_package_file project
		that you can found in the $GAME_EIF_LIB/custom_package_file directory.

		Note that the game custom package file is *NOT* thread-frendly. If you don't use
		any thread, it is not a problem, but if you do use thread, you should not use the
		same object of type GAME_PACKAGE_FILE in two differents threads. You can just 
		use multiple object of type GAME_PACKAGE_FILE to open the same file.
